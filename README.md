## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Broken or missing splash/icon:**  
  - Ensure the PNG is valid (open in an image viewer, not a text editor).
  - File must be in the `public/` folder and named exactly `splash.png` or `icon.png`.
  - The image should load at `/splash.png` or `/icon.png` in your browser.
  - If you see text or a 404, re-save and re-upload the image as described above.

- **Wallet connection issues:**  
  - Make sure you are using a Monad-compatible wallet and are on the Monad testnet.
